                <p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-secondary">Myth #1: Home Health Care is Only for the Elderly.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> While providing dignified <em>elderly care services</em> is a cornerstone of our work, home health care is for people of all ages. CritiHome offers a wide range of services including <em>post-operative care</em>, <em>physiotherapy at home</em> for recovery from injuries or strokes, and even <em>pediatric care</em>. Whether it's a young adult needing rehabilitation or a child with special needs, our <strong>trained nurses and caregivers in Kolkata</strong> provide professional support to every member of the family.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-secondary">Myth #2: Home Care is Less Professional than Hospital Care.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This couldn't be further from the truth. CritiHome’s team comprises highly qualified and experienced professionals, including doctors, <em>registered nurses</em>, and certified physiotherapists. Our standards for care are on par with, or in many cases exceed, those found in hospitals. For instance, we can set up an <strong>ICU at home in Kolkata</strong>, complete with ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and round-the-clock medical staff, ensuring critically ill patients receive the highest level of attention without the stress of a hospital environment.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-secondary">Myth #3: It’s Too Expensive and Only for Wealthy Families.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This is a major misconception. In many scenarios, professional <em>home health care in Kolkata</em> can be a more cost-effective alternative to extended hospital stays or institutional care. We offer customized care plans based on a patient's specific needs and budget, ensuring that quality care is accessible. Our services help to reduce the need for hospital readmissions and can lead to faster, more effective recovery, which ultimately saves families money and time.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold text-secondary">Myth #4: Family Members Can Handle Everything, We Don't Need Professional Help.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> While the love and support of family are invaluable, caregiving can be physically and emotionally draining. Family caregivers often lack the medical training required for tasks like wound dressing, medication management, or administering IVs. CritiHome's <em>home nursing services in Kolkata</em> provide the clinical expertise needed to ensure a patient's safety and well-being. This allows family members to focus on their emotional support role and take a much-needed break from the strenuous demands of full-time caregiving.</p>

That's why we create a personalized <em>home care plan</em> for each patient in Kolkata.
