        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ICU setup at home</li>
            <li>Skilled nursing care</li>
            <li>Doctor consultations</li>
            <li>Physiotherapy</li>
            <li>Medication management</li>
            <li>End-of-life care</li>
            <li>Post-surgical support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
