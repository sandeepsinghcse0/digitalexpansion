                <h3 class="fw-bold text-secondary mt-4">The Overlooked Challenges of Long-Term Care</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Physical Strain:</strong> From assisting with mobility to helping with personal hygiene and repositioning a bedridden patient to prevent bedsores, the physical labor can be exhausting and lead to injuries for the caregiver.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Emotional and Mental Burden:</strong> Witnessing a loved one’s decline is emotionally taxing. The constant stress, anxiety, and isolation can lead to burnout, affecting the caregiver's own health and well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Clinical Complexity:</strong> Managing complex medication schedules, monitoring symptoms, and recognizing subtle changes in a patient's condition requires a level of expertise that most family members do not possess.</li>
                </ul>
